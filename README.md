I created this project for a friend whos into finance

Here's an explanation:
- A number is entered in the input box.
- The number displayed below is the square-root of the number rounded off to 3 decimal figures.
- The first column displays the squares of (num-1), (num-2) till (num-5).
- The second column displays the squares of (num+1), (num+2) till (num+5).

I have no clue what purpose it'll server but I'm happy I took it up as a challenge and made it. I learnt a lot of cool stuff in React and CSS.
